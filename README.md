celss-greenhouse
================

A life-support system mod for Kerbal Space Program.

Requires
--------

TAC Life Support, to provide the life support system this plugs into. Of course, you can install it _without_
TLS, in which case lacking any CarbonDioxide, Waste, or WasteWater to reprocess, it will merely function as an
ornamental part.

What It Is
----------

Well, it's a greenhouse, to close the life-support circle by transforming CarbonDioxide back into Oxygen, WasteWater
back into Water, and Waste ("flush twice, it's a long way to the galley!") back into Food. (At least as long as your
kerbals don't mind a somewhat monotonous diet consisting primarily of algae and tilapia.)

Unlike the mechanical recyclers that TLS provides, the CELSS greenhouse does its recycling with a nominal 100%
efficiency, so long as it's supplied with light. In theory, so long as you have the right number of these, and
keep them powered (to run the pumps and lights), you can keep going on the same amount of oxygen, food, and water
forever. (In practice... well, try not to lose any to venting, accidents, or kerbonauts lost on EVA, 'kay?)

Regarding the right number - a standard CELSS greenhouse can process enough CarbonDioxide, WasteWater, and Waste
to keep two kerbals fed, watered, breathed, and cleaned up after. At the moment, more kerbals means, you guessed it,
more greenhouses.

Why You'd Use It
----------------

For permanent installations, like space stations, or very long voyages, you might want to consider using CELSS
greenhouses instead of mechanical recyclers because over time, that 10% lossage each time around the mechanical
recyclage starts to add up.

It also needs only about a quarter of the ElectricalCharge that its mechanical cousins do because, unlike them, all
it has to run is some pumps and lights. Photosynthesis takes care of the rest.

On the downside, it's substantially less efficient than the mechanical systems, and also considerably more massy. And
so it's rather _less_ suitable where short voyages or small spacecraft are concerned.

Where To Get It
---------------

At this moment, nowhere. I'm not done writing it yet.
