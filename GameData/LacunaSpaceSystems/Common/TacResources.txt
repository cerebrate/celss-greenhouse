The TacResources.cfg file in this folder is cloned from TAC Life Support,
version 0.8. This is to avoid errors when this mod is loaded alone or first.

This should cause no issues so long as the TacResources.cfg file in this mod
remains identical to the proper TacResources.cfg file. If this stops being the
case, go ahead and delete this one.
